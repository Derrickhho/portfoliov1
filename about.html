                <p>"What do you study?"</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s the essential ice breaking question, but for me, it&rsquo;s a question that to a certain effect, burdened me when I first entered the Cornell community. So the direct answer is: Yes, I am a hospitality administration major (or
                    as Cornell refers to us, Hotelies). But please do not use this to push an exaggerated stereotype upon me, or for that matter, everyone else in the Hotel School.</p>
                <p>Within the Cornell community, there is a certain stigma associated with the Hotel School that students there are pre-professional, career oriented, finance and banking focused napkin folders. That classes are easy, everyone is the same,
                    and academics come second to a good hair day.</p>
                <p>And in a way, it would be a fair assumption to assume that someone who decided to concentrate four years in something so particular as hotel administration might be inclined to be career oriented. Or that studying restaurants and customer
                    facing businesses might incite a desire to appear presentable. But to believe that everyone fits in this exact archetype and takes it to an extreme is simply misleading.</p>
                <p>In regards to how <i>I</i> see myself&nbsp;, specifically career-wise, I am a bit of an anomaly. I don&rsquo;t see myself working with real estate, in the hospitality industry, on Wall Street, or any of the career paths hotel students
                    typically take. Instead, what I hope to pursue is a path down <b>digital product design.</b>And as unconventional of a path as it seems for someone in my major, I owe a lot of my experiences in hospitality to guiding me through the
                    unconventional path to get to where I am now.</p>
                <p>For me, getting into hospitality was a means for connecting with people on a more personable level. I loved interacting with and learning about consumer behaviors. The idea that offering the customer the right pen when signing receipts
                    results in higher tips or that organizing tables/chairs a certain way could result in a 50% increase in sales blew my mind. Finding a way to create the best experience for a user/customer was something I was genuinely fascinated in
                    and was excited to learn.</p>
                <p>But at the same time, I had a fascination with technology and design. Growing up in Silicon Valley and having a dad who works as a software engineer all contributed to this upbringing. Solving quantitative and logical puzzles were things
                    I have always enjoyed doing. And while I won&rsquo;t admit to it, a lot of my creativity may have stemmed from the ability to pirate Adobe Photoshop. Being in the hotel school, I was confused. While I was taking classes directly related
                    to cooking and hotel operations, I also loved thinking technically and creatively about things.</p>
                <p>And so like any proper designer would when conducting the initial brainstorm, I looked at only the key elements of my problem.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I was fascinated by consumer behaviors,</li>
                    <li>I wanted to be in a technically minded environment,</li>
                    <li>and I wanted to <b>create</b> something and hone in on my creative passions.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I had no idea what combining these three things would look like, so I cast myself a wide net in terms of career options.</p>
                <p>And it was that first semester upon entering Cornell that I stumbled upon the design team of CUAppDev (Cornell University App Development) during a campus club fair. CUAppDev was a project team on campus dedicated to designing a new iOS
                    application every semester and I thought it sounded like something I might enjoy. I already knew how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, and working in a start-up like environment felt close to home. From there, I used my small portfolio
                    of design work, exaggerated experiences, and some buzz words to somehow squeak through the interview process and be accepted onto the team.</p>
                <p>Upon joining, I quickly realized I was the only non-engineer on the entire team. It was intimidating to say the least, and I kept wondering to myself how I ended up here in the first place. How does someone who learns how to julienne carrots
                    in class relate to a 41 person team of coders. But as I stuck with it, a few notable team members brought me to realize product design was everything I was looking for. It was not so much technical as it was a process of thinking about
                    things. I was able to solve the same consumer behavior problems that got me into hospitality in the first place, and also pick up on the quantifiable methods of user research and testing, all while using the creative tools I was so
                    familiar with.</p>
                <p>Just like in my Hotel Development class where I was analyzing industry and regional data to determine the viability of a hotel in a specific market, I was conducting user research to determine the viability of an app within a specific
                    demographic. Working in this environment was exciting and I thoroughly enjoyed myself as I found a connection back to why I got into hospitality in the first place.</p>
                <p>Over the next couple semesters, my design process became more defined; I mastered more of the industry tools, I gained valuable work experiences, and learned from amazing people on what it meant to work in this field. Most notably, how
                    people in this tech and design industry come from all sorts of backgrounds. One of the most valuable elements in conducting user research is to understand all subsets of users, not just those around you. For me, working in hospitality,
                    where customers come from all sorts of backgrounds, gave me this exposure.</p>
                <p>So while I can&rsquo;t say that too many of my hospitality classes (from Real Estate to Culinary) have directly translated to my hard skills as a product designer, my experiences in hospitality are an integral part of who I am still: <i>one part hotelier and one part product designer.</i></p>
