                    <p>As a user, the reason I take BuzzFeed quizzes is because I related to the content or the people/community that exposed this content to me.

I want to be able to see popular content that is validated by a larger community’s interest.</p>

                    <div class="h-divider"></div>
                    <p>Having worked to brainstorm the scope and goals of this project, I started coming up with possible placements for something like this and where it would have the most significant effect based on our people problem and goals.<br>
                    Below are a few of those explorations:</p>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/PlacementPlan1.png" alt=""></p>
                    <!-- <p>Upon receiving feedback from critique, and speaking with my PM (Dilip Rajan) and fellow designer (Lindsey Marratta), we decided that a module on the bottom of the BPage made the most sense for a number of reasons:</p> -->
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal"  src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/PlacementPlan2.png" alt=""></p>
                </div>

                <hr>
                    
                <!-- Content -->
                <div class="py-3"> 
                    <h1 class=""><a id="What_Content_is_Going_Into_This_Module_55"></a>Content Strategy</h1>
                    <div class="h-divider"></div>
                    <p>With a better understanding of who exactly we wanted to target and what our measurement of success is, I thought about what content made the most sense to populate this module with.</p>
                    <p>In deciding how to do this, I came up with some possible solutions for content population:</p>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/ModuleContent1.png" alt=""></p>
                    <p><strong>Ranked</strong><br>
                    Provide users with a ranking of our best quizzes over a select time period (e.g. Best Quizzes this past month/day/year)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The benefits here would be that this would showcase quizzes that were proven to be the most popular and engaging. This content would have proven to be the ‘highest quality’ and would certainly draw more users in.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Randomized</strong><br>
                    Have a catalog of our best performing quizzes of all time and pull a random number of them for each new session.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This solved a problem with the ranking model where, because there was a hierarchy of a specific timeline, the quizzes shown would remain the same constantly. This meant that users would continue to see the same content in this module repeatedly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Ranking — Revisited</strong><br>
                    One solution we had was to use the ranked model but filter out quizzes that users had already taken. This would solve the ‘same content’ problem we were trying to get at with the randomized content.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>However, the problem with this method was that the same content would still be shown over a long period of time and remain unchanged. If this was truly a hierarchy of content quality, we felt that constantly changing only some of the content shown would confuse the user. Especially if we were trying to get casual users to binge, then showing them a lot of varied content would make more sense than a constant list of high quality content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class=""><a id="Moving_Forward_79"></a>Moving Forward</h2>
                    <!-- <p>Ultimately, after meeting with engineering (Sam Eamon), we decided on a backlog of ~200 most popular quizzes of all time, and randomized through each session. We were still intrigued by the other two concepts, and had them in the back of our minds, but decided to move on with the below solution.</p> -->
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/ModuleContent2.png" alt=""></p>

                    <div class="h-divider"></div>
                    <p>In deciding what layout to move forward with, I kept in mind that we were not focused on a hierarchy, which meant that it might not make sense to place a visual importance on just one ‘featured’ quiz.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I wanted to place as much content in front of the users and offer a larger choice of quizzes in order to align with our original goal of improving quiz consumption.</p>
                    <h2 class=""><a id="Desktop Explorations"></a>Desktop Explorations</h2>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/LayoutExplorations1.png" alt=""></p>
                    <p><strong>3x2 Grid, Side Text</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did the best job differentiating itself from the bottom grid. However, compared to the 2x4 grid, is less space efficient. If the goal was to get as much content in front of users, doesn’t something like the 2x4 grid make the most sense?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Carousel</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entices users to scroll through more content. However, as we’re not necessarily focused on session length more so than quiz consumption, it might make more sense to put more content directly in front of users. This exploration could perform better if it were in a more prominent place such as the Home or Quiz Feed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>2x4 Grid, Bottom Text</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This exposes the user to the most content, which is directly related to our goal. However, visually it gets lost with the bottom grid and could be easily missed when scanning so far past the comments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class=""><a id="Mobile Explorations"></a>Mobile Explorations</h2>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/LayoutExplorations2.png" alt=""></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Side Text:</strong> Similar to that in the desktop exploration. However, wondering if the change in content amount (6 pieces of content vs. 4 pieces) will confuse the user between mobile and desktop experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Carousel:</strong> Could see how this would be interacted with a lot due to partly visible content in carousel. However, unknown if interaction will lead to page views. Additionally, the featured (largest content) seems to dictate that it’s the best quiz of all time and takes away from the other content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Featured:</strong> Same as previous, but does directly place content in front of the user. This exploration makes a lot of sense if we were working with a ranking model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bottom Text:</strong> Similar to comments for the 'Side Text' exploration. But gets very lost in relation to bottom grid.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- <p>Ultimately, I decided on the below layout for the following reasons:</p> -->

                    <div class="h-divider"></div>
                    <p>Next, I looked at refining the module and what specific visual stylings could be used to achieve our project goals. The main thing was differentiating this module from the current bottom grid and drawing as much attention to it as possible considering the content within were some of our most popular quizzes.</p>
                    <p>Part of that was accomplished by the decided on different layout explored above, but what would the container and copy treatment look like and more importantly fit in with the rest of the BuzzFeed product.</p>
                    <p>Below were a few of the explorations I did:</p>
                    <h2>Desktop Explorations</h2>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/VisualDifferentiation1.png" alt=""></p>
                    <h2>Mobile Explorations</h2>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/VisualDifferentiation2.png" alt=""></p>
                    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                    <p>Ultimately coming out of critique, the team felt the below did the best job in differentiating itself and drawing the users attention. At the same time, we already had a similar package treatment used throughout the product, and the use case here made the most sense.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/VisualDifferentiation3.png" alt=""></p>

                    <div class="h-divider"></div>
                    <p>Next, I looked at how the copy might look for this module. As of now, BuzzFeed does not have an official copy guide so the naming of this module was up in the air and I had free reign on direction.</p>
                    <p>Below are a few examples I explored along with a Google Doc sent throughout multiple teams to solicit feedback on:</p>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/bf-1/CopyName1.png" alt=""></p>
                    <p>Understanding that there was no hierarchy to the content being displayed, we wanted a name that left the populated content somewhat vague. In narrowing down my explorations, we avoided words such as Top, Best, All-Time, Most… because it made it seem as if the top listed content was the highest quality.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, we felt that ‘Hall of Fame’ made the most sense as it did not necessarily describe a hierarchy, but more so a collection. We also wanted to add an emoji to the copy in order to draw more attention as some of our other package headlines included one (Shopping, Trending News topics…etc).</p>

                    <h2>Understand the Product and Process Problem</h2>
                    <p>This project taught me a lot about working in a team with other non-designers and how to best communicate my ideas. In soliciting feedback from other people, I learned to frame feedback in a different way than I did in design critiques and focus more on the role of the person I was talking to.</p>

                    <h2>Small Details are a Big Deal</h2>
                    <p>In designing this module, I learned a lot about focusing on the small details and how much they matter. Even with BuzzFeed's styling guide, I found there were so many different ways to explore solutions visually. Whether it be how a container looks, the copy of a design, or the feedback from clicking on links, I learned to design with a high level of attention and detail.</p>
