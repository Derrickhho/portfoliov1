                    <h2 class=""><a id="Project_Description_3"></a>Hypothesis</h2>
                        <p> New users in Paper teams have trouble discovering the value of Paper because they’re not able to find team content of high relevance to them. We hypothesized that prompting existing team members to invite new users to relevant paper docs would lead to higher activation and better onboarding experience.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Surface the collaborative value of Dropbox Paper to new users</li>
                        <li>Increase activation and retention amongst new members within first 30 days</li>

                    <h2 class=""><a id="Key_Results_9"></a>Key Results</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Led to increase in team activation (15% relative life)</li>
                        <li>Led to increase in retention (20% relative lift)</li>

                    <p><strong>1. Activated users</strong> - Most people at Frozen Pineapple Inc. have been using Dropbox Paper for a while. This is what Ann Thompson, their marketing designer (a currently activated user), sees on Paper Home and the problems she deals with.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. New users</strong> - Jay Singh also works at Frozen Pineapple Inc. He just signed up for Dropbox Paper after his co-workers told him about it. He just finished onboarding and went to Paper Home.</p>

                    <p><strong>tl;dr </strong>- A significant percentage of users sign up on teams where there is at least one team doc (62%).  There are opportunities to guide new users towards these docs in order to make them more discoverable.</p>

                    <h2 class=""><a id="Whats_the_Value_Added_For_the_Business_27"></a>How many 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc team users are signing up for teams? </h2>
                    <p>Most people signing up for Paper on teams are not the first user (72%), in fact 40% are the 5th or greater.  This provides a lot of evidence that there is a lot more we can do to optimize  NUX experiences for 2nd+ users.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/dbx-1/opp-1.png" alt=""></p>

                    <h2 class=""><a id="Whats_the_Value_Added_For_the_Business_27"></a>How many existing signups come to teams with one or more public team docs?</h2>
                    <p>62% of team signups happen into teams where there are at least one doc in a Paper team folder.</p>

                    <h2 class=""><a id="Whats_the_Value_Added_For_the_Business_27"></a>Are users who join teams with more existing discoverable content more likely to activate?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, the activation rate increases by nearly 400% going from a zero team docs to a single team doc.  It increases another 50%, going from 1 to 5 public shared docs.  This activation ramp is far more drastic than going from the first user on a team to the fifth user on a team (4%→10%).</p>

                    <h2 class=""><a id="Whats_the_Value_Added_For_the_Business_27"></a>How often do users experience discoverable content upon signing up? </h2>
                    <p>Only 18% of docs created are added to folders.  Of these, only 25% are added to Paper team folders (5% of docs). <strong>This means 95% of docs are non-viewable by a new user signing up for a Paper team.</strong></p>

                <div class="h-divider"></div>
                <p>Having worked to brainstorm the scope and goals of this project, I started coming up with possible placements for something like this and where it would have the most significant effect based on our people problem and goals.<br>
                Below are a few of those explorations:</p>
                <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/dbx-1/flow.png" alt=""></p>

                <div class="h-divider"></div>

                <p>My role in this project was to design a page allowing users to select the proper documents for existing team members to share out. The final design resulted in the following:</p>

                <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/dbx-1/invite-flow.png" alt=""></p>

            </div>

            <div class="pb-3">
                <h1 class=""><a id="People_Problems_and_Goals_22"></a>Layout explorations</h1>
                <div class="h-divider"></div>

                <p>With that I created a set of design explorations with the goal of giving the best method of selecting documents (either in the form of batch invites, or immediate CTAs)</p>

                <p><img class="img-fluid py-3" onClick="large(this)" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="../../img/casestudies/dbx-1/invite-flow-1.png" alt=""></p>

                <p><strong>1. Sidebar View</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best way to see selected items and selection list in same view and allows for later possibility to add personal message with invite (compacted flow vs. additional modal). However, possible tough engineering work (esp with only 2 engineers for the following sprint).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. List Selection</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Larger hit area and readability of document list. However, UI made it not immediately clear what selections are made (could be confusing especially given categorization of docs - Recently viewed, Created by me, Shared with me…).Also required additional modal to insert personal message</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. Actionable List</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quickly actionable and requires less friction for inviting to docs, but had the potential to lead to less documents invited than other explorations. This exploration could also lead to unintentional sharing of documents because there’s less friction involved with the invite action</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Thumbnail View</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate preview of documents and able tp provide social context to the documents to share. Selecting documents is not as clearly defined and also less real estate to show documents</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="h-divider"></div>

                <p>Next steps were to think about what metadata to surface. With this, we interviewed a total of 8 Dropbox users in-person over the course of half a day on the following metadata formats.</p>

                <p>First, I compiled a list of the relevant metadata below that we thought users might be interested in (especially in the context of sharing with other people).</p>

                <p>From there, I formed a number of different explorations that I felt most convicted on and printed them out for a user testing session.</p>

                <p>In addition to the visual design, I worked alongside a UX writer to craft the right messaging that we felt users might best understand. A copy of some of the explorations are shown below</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We hypothesized that prompting existing team members to invite new users to relevant paper docs would lead to higher activation.</li>
                    <li>We predicted that if we make it easier for new users in existing teams to find content of value, we will increase team user activation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class=""><a id="Whats_the_Value_Added_For_the_Business_27"></a>What happened</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiment proved overall successful. Our main success metric of team user activation had a relative lift of 15% — and retention had a relative lift of 20% — This experience was ultimately shipped.</li>
                </ul>
